Paul Modugno was born in Orange in 1935. His father, John Modugno, owned John’s Market at the corner of South Essex and Hulbert Street (now Capuchin Way). Paul grew up in an apartment above the market and worked there along with his sister and parents. As an adult, Paul was an Orange fireman. He later moved to Livingston, but has kept John’s Market open. For the last 30 or so years many of the men who grew up in the Italian neighborhood in Orange between Lincoln Avenue and South Center Street gather at John’s for lunch, to play pinochle, and to talk about the old community. Paul has turned his store into a museum of this community with old photographs and other memorabilia mounted on all of the walls. Some of these are older pictures from his childhood and others are much more recent additions that he and the other guys have put up. These Thursday gatherings are a gold mine for history.

One of the most exciting stories for the men is about playing a game when they were younger called ‘_scata la porta_’ (aka Johnny on the pony). Paul describes the game this way: “one guy used to be against the wall and stand straight up, four guys used to bend down … in a row….The other team used to run and used to get close so the other four could fit on us That’s called scota la porta, ‘on your back’, that what it means. They used to jump on us and if they couldn’t make it [to the end of the row], they had to go down there and stand like that.”
