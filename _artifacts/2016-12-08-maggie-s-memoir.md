Maggie Thompson wrote her memoir at 91.  She called it _From One to Ninety One: A Life_.  She lived at 397 Olcott Street, across the street from Orange Park, for many years. With her daughter Mindy Fullilove and her granddaughter Molly Rose Kaufman, she was a founder of the University of Orange.  
Maggie received her FreeD, University of Orange’s highest degree, for writing the memoir.  Until the book launch party, on July 16, 2011, at Luna Stage, Maggie had thought of her life as unremarkable, and perhaps ineffective. In fact, her life story is an inspiration to many! Maggie fought for justice and equality not just in her political acts but also in her personal choices.  The arc of her remarkable life intersected all the major historical events of the Twentieth Century. She saw the ravages of the Depression in rural Ohio, then engaged in the war effort and experienced tragic loss during World War II. She joined the struggle for Civil Rights, and worked to ensure the rise of labor unions and secure women’s rights. All her life she has engaged the world with feisty intelligence, sharp-witted humor and tenacious courage. She could fly a plan, shoot a gun and shoe a horse. The eager, standing-room-only crowd, and thoughtful readings by friends and family, helped her to see her life in a new way. She was so uplifted by this experience that she “craved it for other people.”  She started a project, called Maggie Ink, to help poor and elderly people write their stories.
