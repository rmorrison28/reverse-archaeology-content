Mayor Dwayne D. Warren organized a meeting at the First United Tabernacle Church to discuss progress on the development of the Central Valley and Highland Train Station. Attendees gathered in the lilac sanctuary on the third floor where Bishop Lloyd L. Faulknor welcomed them.     

Members of the newly formed Historic Preservation Board, and its head, self-described rabble-rouser, Karen Wells, dominated the meeting. Wells challenged Marty Mayes throughout his presentation.  “Why is Orange paying for the restoration of the Highland train station—why not New Jersey transit?” She expressed concern for ADA compliance, particularly on the outside of the station, which is elevated and accessible only by three flights of stairs. She’s been fighting for 27 years for Highland Station. One issue is that NJ Transit provides service based on ridership, which is counted by monthly passes. Some Orange residents, however, buy monthly passes to Mountain Station in neighboring South Orange. Real estate development and train ridership are mutually reinforcing.     

Joseph Alpert, a developer brought into the Valley by HANDS in 2006, spoke. Alpert described how he fell in love with the Valley and the Harvard printing site, which he bought in 2008. He has been trying to get it going since then, and only two weeks ago finally got the financing to move forward. Orange, in his assessment, is “on the verge of exploding.”  Wells pressed Alpert on why the Harvard site was slated for mixed use—why not all market rate condos? Alpert responded that he couldn’t get the financing.     

Andrew Davlouros from HANDS spoke about the “Gateway to Valley Project” which involves eight new affordable units with “creative people.” The refrain of the evening was that the Gateway project was: “bringing people into the Valley who might not have otherwise come,” “Creative people,” and a “great mix of people who are community oriented. People from all over. People who know the Valley.” This would drive ridership on the train line and justify more stops at the Highland Station. “We’re drivers behind Valley development.” We want it “fully occupied by creative people.” Development drives people into the neighborhood who wouldn’t be here. It generates buzz.”    

The bishop remarked at closing that when the church arrived 18 years ago, no one wanted to come to the valley. It was full of drug dealers and the Adams Bar was a real problem. The crowd immediately murmured in agreement. Now, he said, the area is changed for the better.
