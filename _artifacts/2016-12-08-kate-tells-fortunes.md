Kate McCaffrey is an anthropologist.  That means that she studies the ways in which people live together and see the world.  Getting people to talk about this is not as simple as asking, “How do you see the world?”  So Kate thinks about indirect ways to ask the question.  One day, while we were planning for our Reverse Archaeology Lemonade Stand at Oakwood Avenue Community School, she remembered using Tarot cards to tell fortunes.  She didn’t know how to read Tarot cards so she just asked people, “What do you think it means?”  That had led to fascinating conversations.  For the Block Party, June 11, 2016, she organized an orange scarf, a fortune-telling ball, and cards with images on them, showing things like “victim” and “gratitude.”  She also had her “Agent of Alternate Orange” sunglasses.  Thus equipped, she set up her stand, and invited the public to have their fortunes told.  Her stand had a line all afternoon.  People really enjoyed it, and left with lots to think about.  Kate learned a lot about what was on people’s minds, and how they organized their ideas and experiences.  Because she has worked in a variety of places, including Vieques in Puerto Rico, she is able to compare and contrast what she heard in Orange with what she learned in other places.  This helps the Reverse Archaeology Project “unearth the future.”
