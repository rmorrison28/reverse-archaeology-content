  RADICAL: Orange - Responsible Activists Dedicated Intellectuals Cultivating
  Alternative Leadership
---
The 2016 Mayoral race was ugly. Opponents of incumbent Mayor Dwayne Warren, a Democrat, accused him of opportunism and nepotism; he in turn dismissed them as unqualified for office. As the rhetoric heated up, challenger Councilman Kerry Coley, a lifelong Orange resident and former Orange police sergeant, filed a defamation case against Warren, charging that the Mayor falsely accused him of disseminating pornography. Meanwhile, challenger Janice Morrell, a member of the Orange Zoning Board, denounced Warren for his failure to protect the health of Orange residents, alleging that the city’s water supply was contaminated by elevated levels of lead and the newly renovated YMCA on Main Street was poisoned by mold.   

Within this divisive atmosphere, and in an effort to improve youth civic participation, RADICAL: Orange organized a debate of the Mayoral candidates. “Many youth from middle school aged children to young adults in their twenties feel disillusioned by the structure in the City claiming that their voices and concerns do not matter to many officials or other older residents, “ explained RADICAL leaders. “We feel a mayoral debate would provide all of the candidates the opportunity to sell their platform to the youth eligible to vote and help us educate middle and high school students about the political process. As we can see with the current presidential election and with the 2008 and 2012 elections, the youth vote can drastically affect a candidate's chances. The candidates will address topics such as education, public safety, the economy, etc.”  

On the night of the debate, the Unitarian Universalist Church hosted an overflow crowd. The following comments are excerpted from a lively and sometimes heated debate.  

**Question:**  
**Children in Orange are concerned about drugs, guns and violence. They are feeling alienated. They want to know—what are you going to do about gang violence? Are you going to increase the police time?**  

**Coley:** We need to hire more police. That is the only way to improve the response time. Rather than more no show jobs, we need more police. Police now are secretaries on wheels—they are running from one call to the next.  

**Morrell:** We need to ask police to identify gang members. We need to do what Mr. Miller is doing. Sit down and figure out what we can do that is responsive to their needs—job prep, education. We start losing people in 4th grade. We need a solution that is fact based and focused on needs.  

**Warren:** You should know the gang members, get into their heads and innovate programs. The police force would benefit from some retirements.  

**Comments from the audience:**
“We have had a series of shootings in an 8 block radius. What is the police strategy? Why aren’t there cameras? We need 24-hour surveillance. The young people here are traumatized. If I were coming back from Iraq, I would be given support. When the youth here witness someone get their head blown off, they are told to go to school the next day. There is very little support for trauma. This is a collective injury to us.”  

“I went to the last debate. You said crime was lower. How many people from your family have you lost? I am involved, I know the kids, I never stop working. We need to give alternatives to gang members and violence.”  

“How will you restore faith? Everyone who graduates wants to bolt. My friend died here. How will you restore faith and trust?”  

**Responses from the candidates:**  
**Morrell:**  We need to stop and listen. We need to truly listen to what you have to say. Conversation is a two way street.   

**Coley:** We should be routinely meeting with you. You are the folks we are developing for.  

**Warren:** We have to go to where the people are. The people who need to hear us are not in this room.
