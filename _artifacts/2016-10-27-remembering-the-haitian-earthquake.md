Martial arrived late to ESL and was working diligently on his presentation. At about 8:30 he pulled up a podium and asked me to excuse him while he spoke in Kreyòl. It was important to him to address the students on the anniversary of the earthquake.  

His theme was solidarity.  He spoke about how after the quake, the people from the countryside in Haiti absorbed the people from the city who were dislocated and fed them. The media didn’t discuss this much, but the countryside pulled together to sustain the displaced. This is how it is in crisis: people pull together in solidarity. After the crisis subsides, we revert to old patterns and divisions (country vs. city), that’s just life. But remember the solidarity. It is our culture and history that gives us this tremendous resilience.   

He asked everyone to stand for a moment of silence to remember the dead. Then everyone sang the Haitian national anthem. Rodrigue to played a song by a Haitian activist singer. Some of the students joined in song. Then he read a poem about faith and resilience.
