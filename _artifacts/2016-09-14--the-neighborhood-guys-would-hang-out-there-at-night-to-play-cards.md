Debbie Gallo’s grandfather, James Freda, owned a candy store at the corner of South Center and Parrow Streets in the 1950s and 1960s. It was small store with a soda fountain and ice cream. After he retired, the store became a social club, called The Key Club: “the neighborhood guys would hang out there at night to play cards.” The Key Club stayed there “until everybody left.” Carmella and Paul Ianiro also remember the store. Carmella is James Freda’s daughter and Debbie Gallo’s aunt. Paul remembers that the Freda’s store was nicknamed “Tammany Hall” because all of the big players in Orange politics and the leaders of the Italian community would gather there on Sunday’s after services at nearby Mt. Carmel church.
