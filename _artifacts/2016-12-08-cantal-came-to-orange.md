Renowned French urbanist, Michel Cantal-Dupart, came to Orange NJ in April 2009 to consult on a plan for revitalizing the “Heart of Orange.”  The University of Orange, working for the community development corporation, HANDS, Inc, had been asked to make a plan for the area  bounded by Oakwood Avenue, Central Avenue, Scotland Road and Main Street, the poorest and most hollowed-out area of the city.  Cantal toured the area, studied maps, and read about the history.  Then he engaged in a series of events, including a lunch and tour with city leaders, a Placemaking Conference dedicated to touring the Heart of Orange, and a feedback session at the Orange Public Library.  He gave extensive advice, putting the situation in Orange in the context of other cities, for example linking a 1744 gravestone with the 1755 great earthquake that destroyed Lisbon.  He emphasized that a city called “Orange” should be very green and full of fruit trees.  And he demonstrated that two forces had sundered the city, the train and the highway.  The sides of those “rivers” and the “island” between them needed to be greened and beautified to revitalize the area.  “Light the bridges and tunnels,” he said.
