_We are happy to present the book we were working on, called ‘Our Orange: The Discovery of Our Past.’  Being a part of Orange, most people would leave any chance they get. They figure there’s not much of anything positive here, and that there really is no future or potential here. When we started this book, the more tours we took and the more we actually dug into the rich history, we realized that what we thought to be nothing, was actually a big deal. We realized that we are actually part of something that was a lot bigger, and that it was something that we could be glad to call home. In this book we share our insights into the Orange community and what it’s really about._
