ORNG Ink is an arts collective started by high school students in 2008.  They used to operate out of Ironworks and now can be found running creative enterprises and radical organizations all over town. In 2013 Ray Sykes, the greatest mc of all time, described ORNG Ink/Ironworks like this: We have people here that do everything. From people that paint on rocks to people that make movies.  Being here has helped my music because I get to see every walk of life.  I make music out of the stories around me and there are always interesting characters here.  Working with the younger kids is like working with myself how I used to be.  It bridges the gap.
