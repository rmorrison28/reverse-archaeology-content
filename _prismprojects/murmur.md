_Are the places that matter most to you part of the official narrative of your city? Chances are they are not... But projects like [murmur] help to make places matter for everyone. [murmur] was first established in Toronto’s Kensington Market in 2003.  This oral history project came to our precious city from a group of eight Orange High School students in the spring of 2009 who recorded people’s stories about places in their town._
