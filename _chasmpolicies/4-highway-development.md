As early as the 1940s, freeways like 280 were seen as solutions to a perceived problem of urban slums with blighted housing. Highway 280 was built through the center of Orange in the 1960s, a decision that deeply effected the Black and Italian neighborhoods of Orange and destroyed hundreds of homes as well as businesses and community centers.
