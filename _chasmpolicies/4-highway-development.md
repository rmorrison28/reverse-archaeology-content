As early as the 1940s, freeways like 280 were seen as solutions to a perceived problem of urban slums with blighted housing. Thomas MacDonald, director of the Bureau of Public Roads concluded that “it is happy circumstance that living conditions for the family can be re-established [in the new suburbs] and permit the social and economic decay at the heart of cities to be converted to a public assets.” Highway 280 was built through the center of Orange in the 1960s, a decision that deeply effected the Black and Italian neighborhoods of Orange.
