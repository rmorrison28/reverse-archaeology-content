Beginning in 1935, the Federal Home Owners Loan Corporation sent people out to rate neighborhoods to guide investment. The ratings system gave low grades for areas with old buildings and high percentages of foreign born, Jewish or Negro residents, all considered “undesirable racial elements.” Most neighborhoods in Orange received C or D ratings becasue of the city's demographics and aging infrastructure.
