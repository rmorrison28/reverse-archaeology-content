Under the Federal Housing Act of 1949, cities were able to declared areas “blighted,” seize the land using powers of eminent domain, and sell the cleared land to developers at a reduced price. Under urban renewal, 2,500 projects were carried out in 993 American cities, displacing approximately one million people. Seventy-five percent of those displaced were people of color.
